📌 Task 03 - Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning
As part of my Prodigy InfoTech internship, I completed Task 03, where I built a predictive model using machine learning techniques! 🤖📊

🔍 Task Overview:
✔️ Preprocessed the dataset – handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical data.
✔️ Explored feature relationships to understand their impact on predictions.
✔️ Trained machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) to predict outcomes.
✔️ Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

📌 Tools & Libraries Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔗 Dataset: Real-world dataset for classification or regression tasks.

Excited to apply ML techniques to solve real-world problems! 🚀
